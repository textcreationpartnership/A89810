            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am very glad you have given me the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to vindicate my old friend the late Speaker in thoſe reports of his great gains, in the hazardous, and troubleſome imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he hath undergone. 'Tis not eaſy to rectifie a great miſtake when it is ſpread in almoſt every ones opinion, which is commonly believed without Examining the probability of it. I have been very ſtrict in the informing my ſelf of the particulars, and would not have put my hand to them, if I had not been an Eye witneſſe of the truth of what I affirme from the firſt time he enter'd the Houſe as Speaker, to the laſt that he ſate there. You cannot be unacquainted with the greatneſſe of his practice before he was call'd to that imployment; for I having ſeen his accounts, 'twas more then two thouſand pounds <hi>per an.</hi> which now for twenty years he hath loſt. In the firſt two years of his Speaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he kept a publique table, and every day entertained ſeverall Eminent Perſons, as well belonging to the Court, as the Members of Parliament. The King take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Expence of his into conſideration, gave him ſix thouſand pounds, of which there is not to this day the one halfe of it paid. Immediately after the unhappy warre broke out, and it was his chance to have his fortunes lye in the activeſt part of it, ſo that his Eſtate for five years yielded him nothing. The Office of Maſter of the Rolls falling by the death of Sir <hi>Charles Caeſar,</hi> it was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on him; but for ſome years he did not clear his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:132560:3"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 11 -->charges, there being but little proceedings in the Courts of Juſtice, and there being great diminutions of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of that place which his predeceſſors injoy'd, but he did not by reaſon that Wardſhips were taken away, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit accruing by them to eight hundred prounds per an. at the leaſt, and alſo the Biſhops who on every Creation, or Tranſlation paid a conſiderable fee to him, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteemed worth five hundred pounds per an. and the Fines on Orginall writs, which were the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous fees that belong'd to it; ſo that Wardſhips, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the Fines on Originalls being taken away, there was a loſſe to the Office in its profits, two thouſand pounds per an. at the leaſt: yet notwithſtanding he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd a greater duty to the diſpatch of buſineſſe then has been done by any in that imployment before him, and this I think his greateſt Detractors will acknowledge. But that which occaſions moſt the Report of his gaines, proceeds from the fee of five pounds, which was given him by both Houſes upon Compoſitions; and conſidering how much that is in Opinion, and how inconſiderable in the reality of it, makes me as much wonder at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Report, as the readineſſe it has in finding a beliefe. What he received by them is ſo certainly to be known, that if any wil but examin the Journal Books of the Houſe, there they will find every fee for Pardons that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and beſides there is the Clerks, and the Serjeant that attend the Houſe have their fees as well on the Pardons as the private Bills, and is a check to him, ſo that he cannot deceive any one that will but enquire, and with the ſtricteſt enquiry that I can make, both by the Books, and the attendance on the Houſe, I cannot find that ever there could be more coming to him then two thouſand two hundred and twenty pounds, and this is the utmoſt

                  <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->that ever he made on Pardons and private Bills. There was due to him, as there is to every Speaker a fee of five pound <hi>per diem,</hi> which from his firſt ſitting to the laſt he never received one farthing of; Nor did he ever take any ſumme of Money, any gift of land, or any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence or Reward. What other imployment he has had, the labour was ſo great, and the requitall ſo ſmall, that whoſoever ſucceeded him had a ſalary for his pains; yet he perform'd his duty to the place with great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to all, without any. You have now the reality of what he has or could gaine, there being no other way whereby one peny could be ſuppoſed to come to him; and I hope it will give you, and all ſuch as you ſhall thinke fit to communicate it to, full ſatisfaction, as is doth me, that I can affirme this for a truth, and alſo that I am</p>
